PYMACEUDICAL OBSERVATIONS

1 - ONLY TWO DRUGS WERE EFFECTIVE AT DECREASING THE TUMOR VOLUME OVER TIME, CAPOMULIN (-19.48% AFTER 45 DAYS) AND RAMICANE (-22.32% AFTER 45 DAYS).
2 - THREE DRUGS (KETAPRIL, NAFTISOL, STELASYN) PERFORMED WORSE WITH RESPECT TO TUMOR GROWTH THAN NOT TAKING ANY DRUGS AT ALL (PLACEBO).
3 - METATSTATIC SPREAD INCREASED OVER TIME WITH BOTH DRUGS THAT DECREASED TUMOR VOLUME.
